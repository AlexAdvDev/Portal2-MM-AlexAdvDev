# v1.5 vs v2.0
**You may have noticed that there hasn't been a new release for the better half of a year**.

During this time, however, we have restructured the mod almost entirely to allow for better efficiency and more features collectively from 1,022 commits at this point in time. Because of this, the method of updating the mod that we expanded upon in the previous version (v1.5) is deprecated; It will be replaced with a newer, more flexible one.

Because of the amount of stability fixes and new features in the recent version of the mod, we have decided to rename it to version 2.0 rather than 1.6.
As it stands right now, version 1.5 is severely outdated, however, version 2.0 also has its issues with stability, as it is constantly being updated.

The pros and cons are listed below, though we recommend sticking with the latest pre-release. (v2.0)

***Version 1.5***
```
+ Easy to install
+ Gets the job done of having multiple players
+ User-friendly launcher
- Lacks many features
- Rushed codebase
- Existing features may be broken due to binary changes in recent Portal 2 updates
- Only supports the Windows OS
```

***Version 2.0***
```
+ Presents tons new features that were not in 1.5
+ Makes use of a custom plugin to bring about some of the features
+ Full Linux and Windows support
+ Rewritten codebase to allow for efficiency
+ Coded in a way to will more likely work with every Portal 2's continual updates.
+ Stable
+ More organized file-structure
- Will take longer to install (requires that you install Python)
- No launcher (you gotta download the code base and run it yourself) 
- Some features may break as we update the pre-release.
- Not easy to update
```
