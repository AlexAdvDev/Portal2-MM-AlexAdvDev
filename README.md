**Big thanks to our team members: ***cabiste, sear, & Jeffrey*****

<u>**Note: This mod is completely server-side. Only the host needs to run Portal 2 with the mod installed. People who join the host should run stock Portal 2.**</u>

***Version 2.0***
```
+ Presents tons new features that were not in 1.5
+ Much better launcher
+ Makes use of a custom plugin to bring about some of the features
+ Full Linux and Windows support
+ Rewritten codebase to allow for efficiency
+ Coded in a way to more likely work with future Portal 2 updates.
+ A lot more stability than v1.5
+ More organized file-structure
- Will take longer to install (requires that you install Python at this point in time)
- Some features may break as we update the pre-release.
- Not easy to set up
