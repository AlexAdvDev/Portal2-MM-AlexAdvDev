# 1.5 VS 2.0
**You may have noticed that there hasn't been a new release for the better half of a year** ***(234 days at the time of writing)*****.
In this time we have made ALOT of progress** ***(718 commits at the moment)*** **but because of the way that we handled the previous version of the mod,
updating isn't going to be an option until the launcher has been fully finished.
Because of this there are many stability fixes and features (nametags, singleplayer support, linux support, etc) in the new version of the mod 
so many that 1.5 is basically garbage but 2.0 also has its issues mainly being its harder to install and keep stable between updates.
The plan is to make a useable beta for 2.0 but for now you have to choose between 1.5 and 2.0 so a pro's and cons list will be below to help you decide.**

***1.5***
```
+ stable and easy to install
+ updating will be VERY easy once 2.0 comes out
- lacks many features
- very broken
- coded badly
- doesnt work well with the new portal 2 update
- windows only
```

***2.0***
```
+ has many new features (nametags, singleplayer support, chat commands, stability, prop creation, improved spawn detection, spawn in any map, gelocity support, launcher patching)
+ linux support
+ rewitten code (much cleaner and runs way faster)
+ more likely to work with every portal 2 update
+ stable launcher
+ better file-structure
- will take longer to install (requires python)
- can break any time you download a commit
- isn't easy to update
```
